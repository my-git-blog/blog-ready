There has been no issues over the past 10 years. The "Out Sheep" initiative was something that existed, but that didn't really impacted us. Of course, this initiative and the growing nationalism all over Europe and to be frank, all over the world is concerning. All democratic forces have to mobilize to stop this. Recently, I become a victim of a verbal realistic attack. Riding our bike back from school, the driver of a camper van almost hit. She was angry about a person driving "too slowly" in front of her that she forgot that she was in the middle of overtaking a bike (us) and came closer and closer. When I hadn't had space between her and the kerb to the food path, i started screaming to get her attention. She realized her mistake and made room for us again. But her husband on the passenger seat spend the window and said in French, that if I dont speak French, I should leave the country. This wasn't so much of a shock for me as I am aware that this was a shock situation for him as well, but that created the feeling of "we are not wanted here" in my daughter. She cried and didn't know how to deal with the situation. For me this reveled a few things:

1. Racism is real - the guy might have done this in an affect, but it shows his real belives. Believes the right-wing parties seed and exploid. In times of social media more then ever. 
2. The reality of being "third culture", is something we have to address more clearly with our kids. It is important to be aware of why we are here and who we are. This is especially important as we have seen from a daughter of our friends, what can happen, if this is continuously or uncontinuously not addressed [Case study here]. And it also highlights:
3. How sensitive kids are for any kind of hostility and aggression. 

All of the above make me believe, we need to make sure to address this at home and in the school context. It is a reality, we have to be continuos about and help our kids to navigate.
