# a quiet, unspoken condition 
There is a quiet, unspoken condition lived by those who cross borders and remain—not as tourists nor exiles, but as dwellers of another soil. It is not homesickness, nor assimilation. It is something more ambiguous, more fragile, and perhaps more beautiful. Call it the third-culture symptom: the discovery of a self that belongs both nowhere and everywhere at once.

Living in a country not of one’s birth, yet close enough in culture to feel familiar, feels like a paradox. The language may resist: words stumble from the mouth, and idioms never quite settle. Yet beneath this linguistic dissonance lies an uncanny harmony—a recognition in gestures, values, and laughter that allows the foreigner to feel at home among strangers. How strange it is to love and be loved in borrowed words.
